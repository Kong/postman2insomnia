## [1.6.1] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Environment API Export Support** - Fixed detection of Postman environments exported via the Postman API
  - Environments exported through the API lack the `_postman_variable_scope` field present in UI exports
  - Enhanced `isPostmanEnvironment()` function to use schema-based validation instead of scope field dependency
  - Now validates based on core structural properties: `name` (string) and `values` (array) as per official Postman environment schema
  - Added robustness check for variable structure validation when values array is not empty
  - Improved differentiation between environments and collections by checking for absence of `info` and `item` fields
- **Environment Type Detection** - Updated `convertPostmanEnvironment()` to handle missing `_postman_variable_scope` field
  - Defaults to `'environment'` scope when field is missing (API exports)
  - Fixed variable filtering logic to properly handle `enabled` field (now checks `enabled === false` instead of `!enabled`)
  - Added informative workspace descriptions indicating export source (UI vs API)

### Enhanced
- **Function Documentation** - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for environment detection and conversion functions
- **Export Visibility** - Made `isPostmanEnvironment()` and `convertPostmanEnvironment()` functions publicly exportable for testing
- **Error Prevention** - Added collection detection safeguards to prevent false positives

### Technical Details
- **Schema Compliance** - Detection now follows official Postman environment JSON schema requirements
- **Backward Compatibility** - Maintains full compatibility with existing UI-exported environments
- **API Export Coverage** - Comprehensive support for environments exported via Postman API endpoints

## [1.6.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- **Advanced RegExp Pattern Support** - Transform rules now support both string patterns and native RegExp objects
  - Enables complex patterns with lookbehind/lookahead assertions impossible to express as strings
  - Backward compatible: existing string patterns continue to work unchanged
  - RegExp objects bypass flags property (compiled patterns ignore separate flags)
- **New responseBody Transform Rule** - Automatically converts legacy `responseBody` references to `pm.response.text()`
  - Uses sophisticated pattern: `/(?<![\$\.])\bresponseBody\b(?!\$)/g`
  - Avoids false matches like `foo.responseBody` or `responseBody$variable`
  - Targets standalone `responseBody` references commonly found in older Postman collections

### Enhanced
- **Transform Rule Interface** - Extended `TransformRule.pattern` type from `string` to `string | RegExp`
- **Regex Creation Logic** - Intelligent handling of both string and RegExp pattern types
- **Pattern Complexity Support** - Now supports advanced regex features like:
  - Negative lookbehind: `(?<![\$\.])`
  - Negative lookahead: `(?!\$)`
  - Word boundaries with context awareness
  - Pre-compiled RegExp objects for performance

### Technical Details
- **Backward Compatibility** - Zero breaking changes to existing configurations
- **Performance Optimization** - Pre-compiled RegExp objects avoid repeated compilation costs

### Migration Notes
- **No Action Required** - Existing transform configurations work without changes
- **Optional Enhancement** - Complex patterns can be migrated to RegExp objects for better maintainability
- **Flag Behavior** - When using RegExp objects, the `flags` property is ignored (as expected)

### Example Usage
```typescript
// New RegExp pattern support
{
  name: "responseBody-to-response",
  description: "Convert responseBody to pm.response.text()",
  pattern: /(?<![\$\.])\bresponseBody\b(?!\$)/g,  // ← Native RegExp object
  replacement: "pm.response.text()",
  enabled: true
}

// Existing string patterns continue working
{
  name: "legacy-pattern",
  description: "Existing string pattern",
  pattern: "\\bold_syntax\\b",  // ← String pattern (unchanged)
  replacement: "new_syntax",
  flags: "g",
  enabled: true
}
```

### Test Coverage
- RegExp pattern functionality with complex assertions
- Backward compatibility with existing string patterns
- Edge case handling for `responseBody` transformations
- Error handling for invalid patterns

## [1.5.0] - 2025-07-10

### Added
- **Support for experimental rules** - New `--experimental` flag to make use of experimental pre and post processing rules
  - These are replacement rules that have not been confirmed by the Insomnia team yet.
   - The replacements implemented by these rules are suspected to be correct but are not 100% confirmed

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-09

### Added
- **Collection Folder Structure Option** - New `--use-collection-folder` flag to add collection name as containing folder
  - Creates nested structure: `Collection Name > Collection Name > Folders/Requests`
  - Matches Insomnia UI conversion behavior more closely
  - Optional flag with backward compatibility (defaults to `false`)
  - Will become default behavior in future version for UI consistency

### Enhanced
- **Flexible Folder Organization** - Users can now choose between:
  - Original structure (default): `Collection Name > Folders/Requests`
  - Nested structure (new): `Collection Name > Collection Name > Folders/Requests`
- **Type Safety** - Updated `Converter` interface to support new optional parameter
- **CLI Documentation** - Added help text and examples for new folder structure option

### Technical Details
- Extended `ImportPostman` class with optional `addCollectionFolder` parameter
- Updated conversion pipeline to support both folder structure modes
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing conversions
- Added comprehensive unit tests for both structure modes

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Default behavior (original structure)
postman2insomnia collection.json

# New nested structure (matches Insomnia UI)
postman2insomnia collection.json --use-collection-folder

# Combined with other options
postman2insomnia collection.json --use-collection-folder --preprocess --postprocess
```

**Note**: The default behavior remains unchanged for backward compatibility. In a future major version, `--use-collection-folder` will become the default to better match Insomnia UI behavior.
